# Landing Page Project

<!-- Add buttons here -->

<!-- Describe your project in brief -->
This is the Landing Page Project for Udacity! The Navbar at the top of the page should take you to a specific section of text. Scrolling through the page should mark the current section in the view as active.


# Table of contents

<!-- After you have introduced your project, it is a good idea to add a **Table of contents** or **TOC** as **cool** people say it. This would make it easier for people to navigate through your README and find exactly what they are looking for.

Here is a sample TOC(*wow! such cool!*) that is actually the TOC for this README. -->

- [Landing Page Project](#landing-page-project)
- [Table of contents](#table-of-contents)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Development](#development)
- [Footer](#footer)

# Usage
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!-- This is optional and it is used to give the user info on how to use the project after installation. This could be added in the Installation section also. -->
To use the this project, open the index.html file in the project's root folder in your browser of choice. Then scroll through the page or use the navbar to navigate to different sections.

# Development
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)


Most of the code lives in the js/app.js file.
<!-- This is the place where you give instructions to developers on how to modify the code.

You could give **instructions in depth** of **how the code works** and how everything is put together.

You could also give specific instructions to how they can setup their development environment.

Ideally, you should keep the README simple. If you need to add more complex explanations, use a wiki. Check out [this wiki](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter/wiki) for inspiration. -->


# Footer
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!-- Let's also add a footer because I love footers and also you **can** use this to convey important info.

Let's make it an image because by now you have realised that multimedia in images == cool(*please notice the subtle programming joke). -->

<!-- Add the footer here -->
Please feel free to leave feedback and let me know if there are any improvements to be made! ðŸ˜…
